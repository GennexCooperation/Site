	<p class="head">Heptaengine - Basics</p>
	Installation instruction: <br>
	Before you can actually start creating your game, you firstly need to <a href="">install</a> Heptaengine. <br>
	After you have installed Heptaengine.zip rightclick it and press on extract. <br>
	You'll see a couple .py files which we only focus on "engine.py" and "game.py" <br>
	engine.py is the file where you will develop your game while you use game.py to run the game <br>
	.py files can't usually be read on PCs by default. For this you need a Python-Interpreter which can be installed doing following: <br>
	<br>
	Windows: <br>
	-for windows you can just go to the Microsoft Store, search for Python and download it. Alternative you can go to their website and download it there, which is a bit more complicated. <br>
	<br>
	Linux: <br>
	(debian based): sudo apt install python3 <br>
	(fedora): sudo dnf install python3 <br>
	(arch): sudo pacman -S python3 <br>
	<br>
	Mac: <br>
	-just visit their website or download via homebrew <br>
	<br>
	Before you start actually working on any game, it is important to know a couple basic commands. <br>
	<br>
	>> create [gamename] <br>
	with this simple command you create main files of your games <br>
	(you can't name your game "placeholder" since placeholder is a premade constant game with important files to create new games) <br>
	<br>
	>> edit [gamename] <br>
	with this command you choose what game you want to start editing an existing file you created with "create [gamename]". <br>
	(again the game with the name placeholder cannot be edited) <br>
	<br>
	>> remove [gamename] <br>
	with this command you can remove games fully that were created. <br>
	(placeholder is not removable) <br>
	<br>
	>> location <br>
	with this command you can check what game you are currently editing <br>
